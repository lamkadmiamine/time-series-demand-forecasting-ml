# Data Exploration & Feature Engineering

This notebook focuses on exploring demand patterns at SKU level and preparing
a clean and structured dataset for multi-SKU demand forecasting.

The analysis is conducted on a subset of the M5 dataset and serves as the
foundation for machine learning and deep learning models developed later.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This section explores the main characteristics of the demand data:
- Distribution of demand values
- Frequency of zero-demand periods
- Seasonality and temporal patterns across SKUs

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering aims to enrich the dataset with explanatory variables that
capture demand dynamics, seasonality, price effects and promotional impacts.

### Engineered Feature Categories

The following feature groups are created:

- **Zero-demand indicators**
- **Time-based features**
- **Lagged demand features**
- **Rolling statistics**
- **Price-related features**
- **Promotion-related features**

## Final Feature Set for Modeling

The final dataset includes the following features:

**Zero-demand indicators**
- `is_zero`
- `was_zero_last_month`

**Time features**
- `month_sin`, `month_cos`
- `time_idx`

**Promotion features**
- `promo_flag`
- `promo_last_3`
- `promo_foods`
- `promo_hobbies`
- `promo_household`

**Price features**
- `sell_price`
- `price_lag_1`
- `price_change_1`

**Lagged demand features**
- `lag_1, lag_2, ..., lag_n`

**Rolling statistics**
- `roll_mean_3`
- `roll_mean_6`
- `roll_std_6`
